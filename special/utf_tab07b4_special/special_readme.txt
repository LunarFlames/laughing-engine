This is a special build for the encrypted cpk odin.head.cpk from Valkyria Chronicles 2. It is not general purpose yet.
cpk_unpack1.exe does not decrypt the file data, only the @UTF headers needed for parsing.
cpk_unpack2.exe does decrypt the file data with the same method used on the @UTF headers.
As the only data I was able to examine was random either way, I'm not sure which is right.
